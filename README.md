# ⛧ Lily of the Valley
Hello, my name is Lilith Helsente! I go by Lily of the Valley online or LoV for short. I've been an avid gamer since childhood and have been learning game/software development for the past couple years now.

## ⛧ Current Projects
 - An ***Ultra Kill***-like shooter game with an emphasis on precision and speed to survive and complete levels (pre-alpha)

 - A custom UI *icon pack* for ***Dead By Daylight*** that changes almost all of the art and icons found in the game
